# odin-recipes
This is my first development project in the Odin Project. I want to learn how to code because I want to make my ideas  come to life. Specifically, I have had the idea to create an educational web-based platform to let any Mexican student know the academic opportunities, such as academic olympiads, that are available in their state and ultimately in the country. I don't come from a technical background and this is my first formal approach to make this finally happen. I experimented with no code apps, but I want to learn to build my own applications and solutions, this will help me immensely in the long run and will give me more freedom to build my projects. 

This project is a recipe solely in HTML. In this project, I demonstrated the skills of: 
- Git
- GitHub 
- HTML basics such as text, links, headings, images and lists.
